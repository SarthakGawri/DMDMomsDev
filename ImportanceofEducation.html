          “Disability awareness programs are influential to the overall environment of a school. Disability awareness in schools is extremely important because it educates students so they may become better citizens.” (Lindsay & McPherson, 2011). Researchers have found that disability awareness programs at schools have led young children to gain empathy and have positive attitudes. This particular attitude then further grows on an individual, making them better citizens as they mature. Another great aspect of disability awareness at school is that the classrooms are more inclusive and diverse which allows a student to learn more from his/her peers. <br>
          “Many outside influences shape a child’s attitude. They may develop ideas about diversity, life, and people from home, peers, and life experiences but school plays an important role in developing attitude. School is the place where students learn surrounded by other people with many differences. At school, students should learn to be accepting, understanding and friendly”. <br>
